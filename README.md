# ENEE640-Standard-Cell-Placer
Project for ENEE640 VLSI Architecture course at UMD

In this project, I implement a standard-cell placer which can place a set of hard blocks of a net-list in a way that it will optimize the total area and wire-length within a reasonable runtime. 

The placer is based on the **B*-tree** data structure and the **simulated annealing** optimization algorithm.
